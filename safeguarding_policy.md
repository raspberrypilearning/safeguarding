### Created by

### Approved by
#### Philip Colligan (RPF Chief Executive)

*We are committed to reviewing our policy and good practice, which are approved and endorsed by the board of Trustees, once a year.*

*Time of last update: May 2020*
*Time of next review: December 2020*

## Scope:

This policy applies to all staff, Trustees, volunteers and sessional workers, agency staff, and anyone working on behalf of the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF), such as regional bodies, clubs, or national partners. It covers all RPF programmes and activities, including but not limited to Code Club, CoderDojo, Raspberry Jams, Picademy, Coolest Projects, and other events that the RPF leads. Events may be held at venues that have their own safeguarding policies. In these instances, this policy should be seen as a supplement to the venue’s policy.

## Purpose:

- To protect children, young people, and vulnerable adults who take part in RPF activities.
- To provide staff and volunteers with the overarching principles that guide our approach to safeguarding and child protection.

The RPF believes that a child, young person, or vulnerable adult should never experience abuse of any kind. We have a responsibility to promote the welfare of all children, young people, and vulnerable adults, and to keep them safe. We are committed to follow practices that protect them.

## Legal framework:

This policy has been drawn up on the basis of law and guidance that seeks to protect children, including:

UK Children Act 1989, United Convention of the Rights of the Child 1991, UK Data Protection Act 1998 and 2018, UK Human Rights Act 1998, UK Sexual Offences Act 2003, UK Children Act 2004, UK Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, UK Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, UK Children and Families Act 2014, Ireland’s ChildrenFirst 2015.

This policy should be read alongside our [privacy policy](https://www.raspberrypi.org/privacy), [code of behaviour](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2018/12/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation-safeguarding-code_of_behaviour.pdf) for staff and volunteers, [guidelines for social media and communications](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2018/12/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation-safeguarding-social_media_and_communication_guidelines.pdf) for staff and volunteers, and [guidance document on recognising abuse and handling disclosures](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/01/Rasperry-Pi-Foundation-safeguarding-guidance.pdf).

## We recognise that:
- The welfare of the child/young person/vulnerable adult is paramount.
- All children and vulnerable adults, regardless of age, disability, gender, racial heritage, religious belief, sexual orientation or identity, have the right to equal protection from all types of harm and abuse.
- Working in partnership with children, young people, vulnerable adults, parents/guardians, carers, and their agencies is essential for promoting welfare.

## We will seek to safeguard children, young people, and vulnerable adults by:
- **Valuing them, listening to them, and respecting them.**
- **Appointing and training an overall designated safeguarding lead for the RPF,  a lead for each major area of activity, and a lead board member responsible for safeguarding.**
- Adopting safeguarding guidelines through procedures and [a code of behaviour](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2018/12/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation-safeguarding-code_of_behaviour.pdf) (see also the [Code Club-branded version](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/downloads.codeclub.org.uk/CodeClubSafeguardingBehaviourGuide.pdf) and [CoderDojo-branded version](https://help.coderdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004165663-Code-of-Behaviour-volunteers)) and [guidelines for social media and communications](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2018/12/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation-safeguarding-social_media_and_communication_guidelines.pdf) for staff and volunteers. These includes guidance on topics such as avoiding all ‘off-programme’ communication of any form with individual young people; recommended adult-to-child ratios; recruitment, selection, training, and vetting of volunteers; and use of photos and social media.
- **Recruiting staff and volunteers safely,** i.e. ensuring that all necessary checks are made in compliance with local laws and good practice. As such, **all RPF staff are required to undertake a criminal records check** every three years. RPF also requires a [child safeguarding statement for all Irish employees](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.tusla.ie_children-2Dfirst_organisations_what-2Dis-2Da-2Dchild-2Dsafeguarding-2Dstatement_&d=DwMFaQ&c=DpyQ_ftY536pf7wCBQXXU58xADDRY77THQzJu1OmzOo&r=f2N0aLGNSAmNHeTS3LR4VAlgz1yYjN6iEeDhYR2xUqg&m=jk1UJH5mjTOqPPxznCUbsx9FyTUyqUlT69ll2K2jLPI&s=SgPYyhciIm5jdiMT7uD5IOF1X7-dC_37Q_IXNYtRGwg&e=) to comply with local legislation; this will be displayed in RPF offices in Ireland.
- **Providing effective safeguarding training** for staff, Trustees, and volunteers, including [a free online training module](https://raspberrypifoundation.learnupon.com/users/sign_in?next=%2Fdashboard) for all as well as in-depth training for designated safeguarding leads.
- **Ensuring that all RPF national, regional, and growth leader partner agreements include specific safeguarding obligations.** These include (i) following the RPF safeguarding policy and all relevant local legislation and customs, (ii) using our standard online [safeguarding concern report form](https://forms.raspberrypi.org/safeguarding/) for reporting purposes, (iii) completing a safeguarding self-assessment as part of the annual license review, and (iv) sharing our code of behaviour with volunteers.
- Providing [guidance on how to recognise abuse and handle disclosures](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/01/Rasperry-Pi-Foundation-safeguarding-guidance.pdf).
- Using our procedures to manage any allegations against staff and volunteers appropriately (see [our guidance document](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/01/Rasperry-Pi-Foundation-safeguarding-guidance.pdf).
- **Sharing information about concerns with appropriate agencies that need to know (e.g. social services, police),** and involving parents and children appropriately.
- **Ensuring that safeguarding incidents and concerns are consistently reported to RPF management and Trustees** by making all our staff and volunteers aware of our standardised online [safeguarding concern report form](https://forms.raspberrypi.org/safeguarding/), and of our 24-hour telephone support service for urgent safeguarding concerns: +44 (0) 800 1337 112 (UK only) or +44 (0) 203 6377 112.
-  Establishing **appropriate procedures for escalating safeguarding concerns** within RPF and relevant external bodies.
   -  Specifically, designated safeguarding leads are to share any written safeguarding concerns received from staff, volunteers, or partners with the overall RPF safeguarding lead within 24 hours of receipt; the RPF lead in turn is to share these concerns with the RPF Chief Executive and safeguarding lead Trustee within 24 hours of receipt and escalate any significant concerns to the full Board immediately.
- **Creating and maintaining an anti-bullying environment** and ensuring that we have a policy and procedure to help us deal effectively with any bullying that does arise.
- Ensuring that we have **effective complaints and whistleblowing measures** in place.
- Ensuring that we **require a safe physical environment** for our children, young people, staff, and volunteers by applying health and safety measures in accordance with the law and regulatory guidance.
- **Commissioning a third-party audit** of RPF safeguarding policy, practices, and culture every three years.
- Having  an **annual Board review** of RPF safeguarding performance, policy, and procedures.
